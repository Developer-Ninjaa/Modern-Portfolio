        I have a solid grasp of front-end technologies including React, HTML5,
        CSS3, and JavaScript, paired with expertise in back-end tools such as
        Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. My focus lies in delivering smooth
        user interfaces along with robust and scalable backend systems. My
        workflow is centered on performance optimization, clean and modular
        code, and efficient system architecture. I utilize RESTful APIs,
        mobile-first UI principles, and DevOps best practices to ensure
        production-ready outputs.
